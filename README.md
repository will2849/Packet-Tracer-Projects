# Inter-VLAN Routing
This lab demonstrates the configuration of multiple VLANs on a switch and the ability to route between different VLANs through a 'router-on-a-stick' configuration using virtual sub-interfaces.
Appropriate IP addresses were configured for each device and these were then placed within relevant subnets. 


## Objective 
All PCS must be able to ping each other, despite being in different subnets and VLANs.
